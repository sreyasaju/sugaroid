# Interfaces

There are a few possible methods to run sugaroid. It depends on the type of developer / user you are. I offer five versions of the sugaroid which uses the same `core`. 

* [Command Line Interface](./interfaces/interfaces-cli.md)
* [Graphical User Interface](./interfaces/interfaces-gui.md)
* [Web Interface](./interfaces/interfaces-flask.md)
* [Discord Bot](./interfaces/interfaces-discord.md)
* [IRC Bot](./interfaces/interfaces-ircbot.md)
