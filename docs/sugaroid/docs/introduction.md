Your support for this open source software is highly necessary to make this project continued to be served on the world wide web. Consider being my patron to help Sugaroid host its servers or if you are willing to lend servers for Sugaroid, press the sponsor button and email me. Thanks. However, Sugaroid will always remain free forever :smile:



## Acknowledgements 

**Sugaroid AI** has become possible to millions of open source developers. Particularly to mention, I would like to thank **[@GuntherCox](https://github.com/gunthercox)** for the `chatterbot` library and **[@explosion](https://explosion.ai) for [`spaCy`](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy)** , the machine learning library with which it was possible to make natural language processing easy as pie. Also, the millions of word collection on `en_core_web_sm`, `en_core_web_md` was contributed by developers across the globe for translation and linguistic differentiation. I would also like to thank, Sugar Labs 2019 GCI Team, **Sashreek Magan** (aka [@smag](https://github.com/smag)), **Andrea Gonzales** (aka [@andreagon](https://github.com/AndreaGon)), **Zakiyah Hasanah** (aka [@kiy4h](https://github.com/Kiy4h)), **Rishikesh Joshi** (aka [@Creatune](https://github.com/Creatune)), **Szymon** (aka [@sdziuda](https://github.com/sdziuda)) and **Marcus Chong** (aka [@pidddgy](https://github.com/pidddgy)) for continuous testing on servers and reporting bugs. It is only possible to rectify bugs with the help of repeated testing. I would also like to thank friends and family who also helped me to work on this project. Along with this, I would like to extend gratitude to **Microsoft** for sponsoring [Sugaroidâ€™s hosting on Azure](https://sugaroid.azurewebsites.net).



## Introduction

Sugaroid is a new Artificial Intelligence which uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Machine Learning and neural networks to manipulate user input to provide a intuitive response. The AI is built on `Python 3.8.2` and was built out of personal interest, to tackle three important issues in the Python framework

* Natural Language Processing / Machine Learning
* Graphical User Interface
* Database Management, Configuration file management and Web Development

Sugaroid Chatbot has a comprehensive and modular interface utilizing Object Oriented Programming to benefit activities of [Sugarlabs](https://www.sugarlabs.org), a non-profit educational organization. Initially built to serve as a companion bot, the Sugaroid Virtual Assistant helps to comprehend most of the messages, to generate a probable response. The future plans of sugaroid aims to extend Sugaroid as a documentation reader of which beta previews are `still under testing`. 

The Sugaroid bot is deployed in production servers particularly for testing.

* The discord bot
* IRC bot hosted on self when necessary
