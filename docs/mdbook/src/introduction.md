## Introduction

Sugaroid is a new Artificial Intelligence which uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Machine Learning and neural networks to manipulate user input to provide a intuitive response. The AI is built on `Python 3.8.2` and was built out of personal interest, to tackle three important issues in the Python framework

* Natural Language Processing / Machine Learning
* Graphical User Interface
* Database Management, Configuration file management and Web Development

Sugaroid Chatbot has a comprehensive and modular interface utilizing Object Oriented Programming to benefit activities of [Sugarlabs](https://www.sugarlabs.org), a non-profit educational organization. Initially built to serve as a companion bot, the Sugaroid Virtual Assistant helps to comprehend most of the messages, to generate a probable response. The future plans of sugaroid aims to extend Sugaroid as a documentation reader of which beta previews are `still under testing`. 

The Sugaroid bot is deployed in production servers particularly for testing.
