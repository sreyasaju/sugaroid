> **Django** (was) being used in creating Sugaroid web interface, which is however now being replaced by a Flask API backend, temporarily powered by a **Heroku** Server again. This was due to the excessive memory consumed by the Django Server. Django server was too ambitious for a relatively heavy memory using bot like Sugaroid, so Django was peacefully removed.

_Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source._ ~ Django Project ([djangoproject.com](https://djangoproject.com))

Sugaroid has a **Django** based web interface to provide seamless integration of the Sugaroid Bot with the internet. Django's model based database was used to store client communication on the server. Which later became a havoc, because of exponential memory usage.

Sugaroid new API is based on [flask](https://flaskproject.org). and hosted on [api-sugaroid](https://api-sugaroid.herokuapp.com).
