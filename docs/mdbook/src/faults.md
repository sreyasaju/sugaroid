## Invalid Responses

Sometimes, the similarity algorithms may give a completely incorrect answer that may lead to false response by the bot to the user. This is because tensors have no resultant displacement and has multiple direction. To compute zero vectors, SpaCy uses an approximation algorithm called Word Mover Distance. This might lead to unknown predictions. Such predictions should be raised as an issue on the Sugaroid repository to create a tackler adapter that would override the answer with a suitable confidence value.

The other complex and efficient algorithms have been neglected. This is to reduce the size of the distribution as well as reduce the time of installation on an end-user's PC. Complex and accurate Natural Language Processing systems like `pytorch` and `tensorflow` exists, but this may result in the net user installation size to be approximately 2 GB +, which is probably not what the end-user requires.
