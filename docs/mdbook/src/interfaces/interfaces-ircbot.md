## IRC Bot

Sugaroid has an IRC wrapper extension to aid with IRC
(Internet Relay Chat). Sugaroid can receive mentions and process 
them accordingly. This is only possible because of its modular 
nature and object oriented design; Sugaroid bot IRC wrapper 
is experimental and under testing. Disadvantages of IRC includes
no GUI responses from sugaroid's sides and emoticon integration.

Currently, only plain text responses are supported out of the box.
