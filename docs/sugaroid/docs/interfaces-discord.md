Sugaroid also has a discord instance running on a `Heroku` server. Sugaroid Discord bot is powered by Python Async IO, to get faster results and `discord.py`. The discord bot is (somewhat) frequently tested by developers to find it out bugs. The message from the bot is demojized to remove static unicode emoji's and then converted into `emocodes` which is better than unicode emoji's on Discord.
