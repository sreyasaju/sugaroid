## Command Line Interface

Command Line Interface is popular among developers and for those systems with very low memory (< 1024 MB). By default invoking sugaroid entrypoint triggers the command line interface. You are likely to be greeted with an ASCII image of Sugaroid (forgive me Windows Users, I am not interested in developing a ASCII colored image of Sugaroid)
